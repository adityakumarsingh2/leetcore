# LeetCore

> Master the Core of Data Structures & Algorithms

LeetCore is a full-stack DSA learning and practice platform designed to provide a structured roadmap, real-time code execution, and performance tracking. It integrates a high-performance C++ computation engine with a modern React frontend and Node.js backend to deliver an efficient and scalable learning experience.

---

## Overview

LeetCore aims to bridge the gap between learning and implementation by combining:

* 📚 Structured DSA roadmap
* 💻 Built-in coding IDE
* ⚡ Real-time code execution (C++)
* 📊 Progress tracking and analytics
* 🎬 Algorithm visualization (planned)

This platform is designed to simulate a real-world coding environment while helping users build strong problem-solving skills.

## System Architecture

```
React (Frontend UI)
        ↓
Node.js (API Layer / Controller)
        ↓
C++ Engine (Execution & DSA Logic)
```

### Key Responsibilities:

* **Frontend (React):**

  * User interface
  * IDE and visualization
  * Dashboard and roadmap

* **Backend (Node.js):**
